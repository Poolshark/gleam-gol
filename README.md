GleamLife: Experience the mesmerizing simplicity of Conway's Game of Life brought to life in Gleam. Harnessing the power of functional programming, this implementation offers a visually captivating journey into the realm of cellular automata, where patterns emerge and evolve with each iteration.

> **Note :** I want to emphasise taht I am very new to Gleam and thus some patterns might be a bit confusing. However, feel free to come up with suggestions of how to make it better, I'd be more than happy to see it evolve!

### Run the code

Run GOL with a **randomised** seed.

```sh
gleam run
```

For **testing purposes** you can also play around with the following parameters in `gol.gleam â†’ run(run_time, intervall, total_time, initial, grid_size)`:

- `run_time` â†’ set to `0` (determines the start time)
- `intervall` â†’ update intervall in `ms`
- `total_time` â†’ total program runtime in `ms`
- `initial` â†’ determins the initial seeding condition. Can be one of the following:

  - `Random` â†’ random seed
  - `Glider` â†’ a _Spaceship_ seed which moves from the top left to the bottom right corner of the grid
  - `Blinker` â†’ the most simple _static oscillator_
  - and many more. Check `lib/initial_conditions.gleam` for more. **NOTE: most of them are untestet!**

  Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
